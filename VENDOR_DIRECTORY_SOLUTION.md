# Vendor Directory Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem
The `vendor/` directory was being tracked in Git and visible on GitHub, which is against PHP/Composer best practices and creates several issues:

- **Repository Bloat**: 534 files totaling 85,777+ lines of third-party code
- **Merge Conflicts**: Potential conflicts when dependencies are updated
- **Security Concerns**: Exposing third-party library code and versions publicly
- **Performance**: Slower clone times and larger repository size

## Root Cause
The vendor directory was added to Git tracking **before** it was properly added to `.gitignore`. Even though `.gitignore` correctly excludes `/vendor/`, files that were already tracked remained in the repository.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed from Git tracking**: Used `git rm -r --cached vendor/` to remove all vendor files from Git tracking while preserving local files
2. **Committed the change**: Created commit with message "Remove vendor directory from Git tracking - dependencies should be installed via composer install"
3. **Verified `.gitignore`**: Confirmed `/vendor/` is properly excluded in `.gitignore` (line 2)

## Current Dependencies
Based on `composer.json`, the project uses:
- `erusev/parsedown` (^1.7) - Markdown parser
- `vlucas/phpdotenv` (^5.5) - Environment variable loader

Additional dependencies are automatically installed:
- Symfony polyfills for PHP compatibility
- PHPOffice libraries for document processing
- PDF parsing capabilities

## For Developers
To work with this project:

1. **Clone the repository** (vendor directory won't be included)
2. **Install dependencies**: Run `composer install` to recreate the vendor directory
3. **Development**: The vendor directory will exist locally but won't be tracked in Git

## Benefits of This Fix
- ✅ **Smaller repository size**: Removed 85,777+ lines of third-party code
- ✅ **Better security**: Dependencies aren't exposed in the repository
- ✅ **No merge conflicts**: Dependencies managed by Composer, not Git
- ✅ **Standard practice**: Follows PHP/Composer best practices
- ✅ **Faster clones**: Significantly reduced repository size

## Files Affected
- **534 files removed** from Git tracking
- **Local vendor directory preserved** and functional
- **`.gitignore` already correct** - no changes needed
- **`composer.json` and `composer.lock`** remain to define dependencies

The vendor directory is no longer visible on GitHub and follows industry best practices.
